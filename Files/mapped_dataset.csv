Multiple vulnerabilities were identified:



- The MQTT backend does not require authentication, allowing unauthorized connections from an attacker.



- The vehicles publish their telemetry data (e.g. GPS Location, speed, odometer, fuel, etc) as messages in public topics. The backend also sends commands to the vehicles as MQTT posts in public topics. As a result, an attacker can access the confidential data of the entire fleet that is managed by the backend.



- The MQTT messages sent by the vehicles or the backend are not encrypted or authenticated. An attacker can create and post messages to impersonate a vehicle or the backend. The attacker could then, for example, send incorrect information to the backend about the vehicle's location.



- The backend can inject data into a vehicle´s CAN bus by sending a specific MQTT message on a public topic. Because these messages are not authenticated or encrypted, an attacker could impersonate the backend, create a fake message and inject CAN data in any vehicle managed by the backend.

147,Unauthorized Access to Angular Sensors,83,CVE-2023-3028,Gained unauthorized control over angular motion sensors.,Ability to manipulate vehicle trajectory inputs.,0,"Insufficient authentication in the MQTT backend (broker) allows an attacker to access and even manipulate the telemetry data of the entire fleet of vehicles using the HopeChart HQT-401 telematics unit. Other models are possibly affected too.








Multiple vulnerabilities were identified:



- The MQTT backend does not require authentication, allowing unauthorized connections from an attacker.



- The vehicles publish their telemetry data (e.g. GPS Location, speed, odometer, fuel, etc) as messages in public topics. The backend also sends commands to the vehicles as MQTT posts in public topics. As a result, an attacker can access the confidential data of the entire fleet that is managed by the backend.



- The MQTT messages sent by the vehicles or the backend are not encrypted or authenticated. An attacker can create and post messages to impersonate a vehicle or the backend. The attacker could then, for example, send incorrect information to the backend about the vehicle's location.



- The backend can inject data into a vehicle´s CAN bus by sending a specific MQTT message on a public topic. Because these messages are not authenticated or encrypted, an attacker could impersonate the backend, create a fake message and inject CAN data in any vehicle managed by the backend.

nilfs2: fix failure to detect DAT corruption in btree and direct mappings

Patch series ""nilfs2: fix kernel bug at submit_bh_wbc()"".

This resolves a kernel BUG reported by syzbot.  Since there are two
flaws involved, I've made each one a separate patch.

The first patch alone resolves the syzbot-reported bug, but I think
both fixes should be sent to stable, so I've tagged them as such.


This patch (of 2):

Syzbot has reported a kernel bug in submit_bh_wbc() when writing file data
to a nilfs2 file system whose metadata is corrupted.

There are two flaws involved in this issue.

The first flaw is that when nilfs_get_block() locates a data block using
btree or direct mapping, if the disk address translation routine
nilfs_dat_translate() fails with internal code -ENOENT due to DAT metadata
corruption, it can be passed back to nilfs_get_block().  This causes
nilfs_get_block() to misidentify an existing block as non-existent,
causing both data block lookup and insertion to fail inconsistently.

The second flaw is that nilfs_get_block() returns a successful status in
this inconsistent state.  This causes the caller __block_write_begin_int()
or others to request a read even though the buffer is not mapped,
resulting in a BUG_ON check for the BH_Mapped flag in submit_bh_wbc()
failing.

This fixes the first issue by changing the return value to code -EINVAL
when a conversion using DAT fails with code -ENOENT, avoiding the
conflicting condition that leads to the kernel bug described above.  Here,
code -EINVAL indicates that metadata corruption was detected during the
block lookup, which will be properly handled as a file system error and
converted to -EIO when passing through the nilfs2 bmap layer.",5.5,MEDIUM,LOCAL,LOW,LOW,NONE,1.8,3.6,Unknown,No description available,False,0,0,1,,,,

fsdax: dax_unshare_iter needs to copy entire blocks

The code that copies data from srcmap to iomap in dax_unshare_iter is
very very broken, which bfoster's recent fsx changes have exposed.

If the pos and len passed to dax_file_unshare are not aligned to an
fsblock boundary, the iter pos and length in the _iter function will
reflect this unalignment.

dax_iomap_direct_access always returns a pointer to the start of the
kmapped fsdax page, even if its pos argument is in the middle of that
page.  This is catastrophic for data integrity when iter->pos is not
aligned to a page, because daddr/saddr do not point to the same byte in
the file as iter->pos.  Hence we corrupt user data by copying it to the
wrong place.

If iter->pos + iomap_length() in the _iter function not aligned to a
page, then we fail to copy a full block, and only partially populate the
destination block.  This is catastrophic for data confidentiality
because we expose stale pmem contents.

Fix both of these issues by aligning copy_pos/copy_len to a page
boundary (remember, this is fsdax so 1 fsblock == 1 base page) so that
we always copy full blocks.

We're not done yet -- there's no call to invalidate_inode_pages2_range,
so programs that have the file range mmap'd will continue accessing the
old memory mapping after the file metadata updates have completed.

Be careful with the return value -- if the unshare succeeds, we still
need to return the number of bytes that the iomap iter thinks we're
operating on.",7.1,HIGH,LOCAL,LOW,LOW,NONE,1.8,5.2,Primary,NVD-CWE-noinfo,True,1,1,0,,,,

According to FSCT-2022-0054, there is a Honeywell Experion PKS Safety Manager unauthenticated firmware update issue. The affected components are characterized as: Firmware update functionality. The potential impact is: Firmware manipulation. The Honeywell Experion PKS Safety Manager utilizes the DCOM-232/485 communication FTA serial interface and Enea POLO bootloader for firmware management purposes. An engineering workstation running the Safety Builder software communicates via serial or serial-over-ethernet link with the DCOM-232/485 interface. Firmware images were found to have no authentication (in the form of firmware signing) and only relied on insecure checksums for regular integrity checks. Firmware images are unsigned. An attacker with access to the serial interface (either through physical access, a compromised EWS or an exposed serial-to-ethernet gateway) can utilize hardcoded credentials (see FSCT-2022-0052) for the POLO bootloader to control the boot process and push malicious firmware images to the controller allowing for firmware manipulation, remote code execution and denial of service impacts. A mitigating factor is that in order for a firmware update to be initiated, the Safety Manager has to be rebooted which is typically done by means of physical controls on the Safety Manager itself. As such, an attacker would have to either lay dormant until a legitimate reboot occurs or possibly attempt to force a reboot through a secondary vulnerability.",6.8,MEDIUM,PHYSICAL,LOW,NONE,NONE,0.9,5.9,Primary,CWE-354,True,1,1,1,,,,
